# flask-website
Learning Flask by building my own website from scratch. I intend to use this for professional/career purposes, but I might also add a blog at some point...

When running the `flask` server, always `source flaskenv.sh` first, then `flask run` from the top directory.

Make sure to configure `application/database/db_config.py` with the proper database credentials before connecting. There is sensitive information in there, so it will not be version controlled.

I'm using some javascript plugin called Chosen for multiselect dropdowns:
```bash
wget https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/releases/download/v1.8.7/chosen_v1.8.7.zip
```
