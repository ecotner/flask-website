# Data scientist
Currently working as a Data Scientist at [American Tire Distributors](https://www.atd-us.com/en), where I support supply chain operations. My work involves a wide array of data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, forecasting, clustering, statistics, decision science, and optimization. I get to work with an all-star group of data scientists, engineers, and architects at the [Advanced Analytics Center of Excellence](https://medium.com/@americantiredistributors/hello-world-meet-the-data-analytics-addicts-at-american-tire-distributors-16de0a7bceb8).

# Theoretical astroparticle physicist
Recently graduated (Sept. 2018) from UCLA with a PhD in physics under the mentorship of [Alexander Kusenko](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~kusenko/). The focus of my research was exotic dark matter candidates formed from scalar condensates in the early universe, which includes $Q$-balls, boson stars, and [primordial black holes](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-physicists-propose-new-theories-of-black-holes-from-the-very-early-universe). It is an interesting blend of particle physics, conventional astrophysics, and physical cosmology.

# Teacher
During my graduate studies I was given the opportunity to teach a wide variety of undergraduate physics classes, ranging from introductory physics 101 for freshman biology majors to upper-division nuclear and particle physics for advanced junior/senior physics majors. I have won multiple awards for my teaching, and the experience has given me a lot of practical knowledge in distilling down complex ideas to simple ones, and how to communicate them effectively.

# Diver
I have been an active scuba diver since April 2018, and since then have obtained both my _Open Water_ and _Advanced Open Water_ certifications. I have had the fortune to explore many interesting dive sites in locations such as Los Angeles, Mexico, North Carolina, Australia, and Honduras, and hope to visit many more.
