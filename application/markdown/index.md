# üìä Data scientist
Currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at [Shipt](https://www.shipt.com), where I research marketplace optimization, specifically for the "offering" service, where we come up with better, more efficient and fulfilling ways to match shoppers to orders they deliver.
This typically involves using machine learning to quantify how good of a match a certain shopper/order pair will be, followed by combinatorial optimization to determine the best matching assignment.

Before that, I was a Lead Data Scientist at [Torqata](https://torqata.com), a data start-up which is a subsidiary of [American Tire Distributors](https://www.atd-us.com/en), where I supported supply chain operations.
My work involved a wide array of data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, forecasting, clustering, statistics, decision science, and optimization.

# ‚öõÔ∏è Theoretical astroparticle physicist
Recently graduated (Sept. 2018) from UCLA with a PhD in physics under the mentorship of [Alexander Kusenko](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~kusenko/). The focus of my research was exotic dark matter candidates formed from scalar condensates in the early universe, which includes Q-balls, boson stars, and [primordial black holes](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-physicists-propose-new-theories-of-black-holes-from-the-very-early-universe). It is an interesting blend of particle physics, conventional astrophysics, and physical cosmology.

# üéì Educator
During my graduate studies I was given the opportunity to teach a wide variety of undergraduate physics classes, ranging from introductory physics 101 for freshman biology majors to upper-division nuclear and particle physics for advanced junior/senior physics majors. I have won multiple awards for my teaching, and the experience has given me a lot of practical knowledge in distilling down complex ideas to simple ones, and how to communicate them effectively.

# ü§ø Diver
I have been an active scuba diver since April 2018, and since then have obtained both my *Open Water* and *Advanced Open Water* certifications. I have had the fortune to explore many interesting dive sites in locations such as Los Angeles, Mexico, North Carolina, Australia, and Honduras, and hope to visit many more.
